It's easy to be lazy these days and give up on the decentralized property of the Internet. You can find pretty much everything that requires more than a minute to set up "as a service". I hadn't self-hosted my blog for years. What prompted me to go back to self-hosting from Medium?

Tracking of readers was a concern but didn't bothered me enough to make the effort of self-hosting. I was increasingly frustrated about not having control over the layout of my posts, not being able to embed code without having to embed a GitHub Gist. And since Medium isn't monetized yet, I had some uncertainties about the future of the platform.

Welcome to this new home.

The pleasure of self-hosting my blog also comes with my renewed love for RSS. You can [subscribe](https://www.fredericjacobs.com/blog/feed.xml) to get all the blog posts, without the noise of having to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FredericJacobs).

Note: Previous [blog posts](https://medium.com/@FredericJacobs) will stay on Medium.
