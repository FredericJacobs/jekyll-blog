Along with [Chris Wood](https://chris-wood.github.io) and [Frank Denis](https://00f.net), we have an [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9474/) for RSA Blind Signatures for adoption in schemes like Privacy Pass.

A [security analysis of the scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/895) was also done by Anna Lysyanskaya.
